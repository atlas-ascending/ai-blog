"The orchid is a fragile flower

That blooms in the darkest of hours

Its petals are delicate and thin

And its aroma is sweet and faint

This flower is a rare gem

That is cherished by all who see it

For its beauty is unrivaled

And its grace is divine

The orchid is a symbol of hope

And its presence is a sign of good things to come

This flower is a reminder that even in the darkest of times

There is always beauty to be found"
